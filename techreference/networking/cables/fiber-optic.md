# Fiber-optic

Fiber-optic cables have a glass or plastic core that allows light to pass through it.  Around the core is a layer called cladding, which is reflective to allow the light to bounce of it. The outside is coated with a polymer, with Kevlar running between the core and the coating to add strength and protection. They have a bend radius of 3.0cm after which they can develop micro-fractures, complete fractures, or severely leak light.

## Connector Types

* ST - Bayonet style or a straight tip connector
* SC - Subscriber connector
* LC - lucent connector

Types of Cables

* Single mode - Light travels in a single path and has a very small core, so that there is only one path for the light to travel. Supports use of a laser light
* Multimode - Has a large core so that there are many paths for the light to take. Can use a laser light or LED.
