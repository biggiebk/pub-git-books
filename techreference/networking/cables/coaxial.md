# Coaxial

A coaxial cable is made of one big copper wire, layer of insulation, shielding, and is wrapped in a jacket. Coaxial is most commonly used in RG-62 networks that utilize one central line called a bus. &#x20;

## Connector Types

* T-Connector - Attaches the a node to the bus line.
* End  Connector - Commonly a BNC and is used to connect the cable to other connector types.
* Terminator - Used to terminate the main bus and contains a resistor which redirects the electrons to the shielding and keeps the signal moving.
* Coupler - used to extend cables.
